Write tests and implementation code
for TaxCalculator using JUnit framework.

TaxCalculator rules:

1) Income up to 20000 is taxed at 25%
2) Income of more than 20000 is taxed at 40%
3) Income of more than 50000 is taxed at 50%

Write tests first!
Tests should drive implementation!
Use Test Driven Development (TDD) approach!
After all refactor your production code and tests!
