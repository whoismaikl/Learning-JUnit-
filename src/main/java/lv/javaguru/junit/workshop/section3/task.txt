Write tests for three domains:

1) TaxCalculator
        Implement following rules:
        // Rule 1: if current year < 2010 then tax = 18%
        // Rule 2: if current year = 2010 then tax = 22%
        // Rule 3: if current year > 2010 then tax = 21%

2) Database:
        DatabaseFacadeImpl

3) Validation:
        EmptyRule
        PasswordRule
        UserPolicy

Use Mockito to mock all dependencies of class under test.
