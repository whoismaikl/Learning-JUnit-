Task for development: Implement rule 5.


There are several rules for logging in to our system:

1) When logging in,
   a user provides a login and password.

2) The login is a non-blank,
   unique string containing just about any characters.
   If login is not provided then throw exception.

3) The password is a non-blank,
   unique string containing just about any characters.
   If password is not provided then throw exception.

4) If database contain user with provided credentials,
   then user must be successfully logged to application.
   Else throw exception.

5) If a user attempts to log in and provides a
   valid login but invalid password three times,
   their account is revoked, and can only be enabled
   by calling customer support.
